This github organization gathers the prototypes / proofs of concept developed by <a href="https://block0.io/" target="blank">block0</a> for several SMEs, in the scope of the <a href="https://blockstartproject.eu/" target="blank">Blockstart European Project</a>.
The goal was to verify the interest of using a blockchain to replace or extend the capabilities of systems used by these SMEs.

Use case descriptions, detailed documentation and reports are not published here.

Although each project was developed with great care, they are still prototypes and are not ready for production use.
